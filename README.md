We developed an Emotion-Aware RAG system that detects user emotions, retrieves emotionally relevant mental health posts, and generates empathetic replies using lightweight language models like Phi-3 Mini.

By combining retrieval with generation, we ensure safer, contextually grounded responses.

The system was evaluated for emotion detection, retrieval precision, and response quality, achieving strong performance across all metrics.

This project shows how AI can be responsibly applied to support mental health.
